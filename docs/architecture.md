# AI Interview Simulator Architecture (DRAFT)

## Overview

The AI Interview Simulator is a microservices-based application designed to provide realistic interview experiences through AI-powered interactions. The system is built using modern technologies and follows a distributed architecture pattern.

## System Architecture

[System Architecture Diagram Placeholder]

The system consists of the following main components:

1. Frontend (React + TypeScript)
2. Backend Microservices (Python)
3. Shared Utilities
4. Infrastructure Components

## Frontend

The frontend is built using React with TypeScript, providing a modern and responsive user interface.

### Key Components:
- WebSocket-based real-time communication
- TypeScript for type safety
- Modern UI components
- Real-time video/audio streaming

  - Google Cloud Text-to-Speech for voice synthesis
- Multi-Modal Sentiment Analysis
  - Text sentiment analysis using DistilBERT
  - Facial expression analysis using DeepFace
- Conversation Management
  - DialoGPT-based response generation
  - Interview questionnaire system
  - Response evaluation and feedback
- Interview State Management
  - Interview lifecycle control
  - Progress tracking
  - Checklist management

#### Key Features:
- Real-time speech processing
- Natural language understanding
- Dynamic response generation
- Multi-modal sentiment analysis
- Interview progress tracking
- Comprehensive feedback generation
- Interview summarization

## Data Flow

[Data Flow Diagram Placeholder]

1. User initiates interview
2. Frontend establishes WebSocket connection
3. Interaction Service processes speech/text
4. AI generates responses
5. Results are streamed back to user

## Security

- Authentication and authorization
- Secure WebSocket connections
- Data encryption
- Rate limiting
- Input validation

## Deployment

### Local Development
